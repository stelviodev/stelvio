# Stelvio v0.3.0 Marketing Posts


6. **Personal Dev Environments**
   ```
   Every developer gets their own AWS sandbox by default.
   
   stlv deploy ‚Üí deploys to username-prefixed resources
   
   No more "who deployed what?" No more resource conflicts.
   
   Built for real teams, not tutorials.
   ```

7. **Python-Only Infrastructure**
   ```
   Your entire AWS infrastructure in one Python file:
   
   @app.config
   def config():
       return {"project": "my-api"}
   
   @app.run  
   def run():
       api = ApiGateway("api")
       fn = Function("handler", handler="main.handler")
       api.route("GET", "/hello", fn)
   
   That's it. No YAML. No JSON. Just Python.
   ```

8. **Compare to Other Tools**
   ```
   Terraform: Write HCL, manage state files
   CDK: Write TypeScript/Python, compile to CloudFormation
   Serverless Framework: Write YAML, limited to serverless
   
   Stelvio: Write Python. Deploy. Done.
   ```

9. **No CloudFormation Limits**
   ```
   Stelvio uses Pulumi under the hood, not CloudFormation.
   
   That means:
   - No 500 resource limit
   - No 60-minute timeout
   - No CloudFormation quirks
   
   Just direct AWS API calls.
   ```

10. **The Decorator Pattern**
    ```
    Clean separation of config and infrastructure:
    
    @app.config ‚Üí AWS settings, project name
    @app.run ‚Üí Your actual infrastructure
    
    No more mixing config with code.
    ```

## Thread Ideas

21. **"Why We Built Stelvio" Thread**
    - 1/ Frustrated with YAML and JSON for infrastructure
    - 2/ Pulumi is powerful but complex to set up
    - 3/ Every team needs dev environments but few have them
    - 4/ We wanted `git clone` ‚Üí `deploy` simplicity
    - 5/ So we built Stelvio...

22. **"Hidden Features" Thread**
    - 1/ üßµ Hidden gems in Stelvio v0.3.0 you might miss:
    - 2/ Auto-passphrase management via AWS Parameter Store
    - 3/ --show-unchanged flag for detailed resource views
    - 4/ Automatic Lambda environment variables for resource discovery
    - 5/ Link system for automatic IAM permissions

23. **"Real World Example" Thread**
    - 1/ Let's build a real API with Stelvio:
    - 2/ User registration endpoint
    - 3/ DynamoDB for storage
    - 4/ Automatic IAM permissions via Links
    - 5/ Deployed in under 50 lines of Python

## Code Comparison Posts

    - Highlight verbosity difference

25. **CDK vs Stelvio**
    - Show CDK's boilerplate vs Stelvio's simplicity
    - Same Lambda + API Gateway setup

## Community/Ecosystem Posts

26. **Open Source Love**
    ```
    Stelvio is built on amazing open source:
    - @pulumicorp for infrastructure engine
    - @willmcgugan's Rich for beautiful terminals
    - @astral-sh's uv for fast Python
    
    Standing on the shoulders of giants üôè
    ```

27. **Call for Feedback**
    ```
    Stelvio v0.3.0 is alpha but ambitious.
    
    We need your feedback:
    - What AWS services do you need?
    - What's frustrating about current tools?
    - What would make your life easier?
    
    Help us build the future of Python infrastructure.
    ```

28. **Documentation Pride**
    ```
    We spent as much time on docs as on code.
    
    - Quickstart that actually works
    - Real examples, not toy demos  
    - Guides for common patterns
    
    Because great tools deserve great docs.
    
    [link to docs]
    ```

## Meme/Fun Posts

29. **Virgin YAML vs Chad Python**
    - Meme format comparing infrastructure as config vs code

30. **"It's Just Python" Reaction**
    - That moment when you realize you can use loops, conditionals, and functions in your infrastructure code

## Technical Deep Dives

31. **How We Handle IAM**
    ```
    The worst part of AWS? IAM permissions.
    
    Stelvio's Link system:
    - Function needs DynamoDB? Just link them.
    - API needs Lambda? Automatic permissions.
    - No more googling IAM policies.
    ```

32. **Component Registry Pattern**
    ```
    Every Stelvio component self-registers.
    
    This enables:
    - Automatic resource discovery
    - Cross-component linking
    - Global uniqueness validation
    
    Simple idea, powerful results.
    ```
